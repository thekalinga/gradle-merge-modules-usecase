Showcases the case when the packages of a library are split across multiple jars & in this case some classes are the same.

As you can see the library `xmlpull` exposes `org.xmlpull.v1` packages with just 2 classes & `org.xmlpull.mxp1` that are unique to this jar, where as `kxml2` exposes `org.kxml2` & `org.xmlpull.v1` which has 4 classes
